# haskell-playground

Personal workspace for learning Haskell with [Learn You a Ã¸haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com) and
exercises
from [Noel Markham](https://github.com/noelmarkham/learn-you-a-haskell-exercises/blob/master/02-starting-out.hs).

Project started with [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/), using `stack new haskell-playground simple`.
